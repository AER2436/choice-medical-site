- **10/23/2024** Doesn't like what was sent, is asking for something with velcro closure. I found **12282** which she said looks like it. It is coded **A4425** - $4.88 each

- **10/1/2024** She has asked to switch again to Coloplast SenSura Mio 2-piece Flex. Preferred show these to be ~~18656 (pouch)~~ and 10571 (wafer). Might need to try the new place, Milliken, as preferred are showing out of stock again. Pricing should work - and it is better in Milliken
    
- ~~18656 HCPCS A4413 allowable is $7.52 each. Cost at Preferred $32.77 for box of 10 = $3.28 each. So pay $65.54, get reimbursed $150.40
    
- 10571 HCPCS A4415 allowable is $8.18 each. Cost at Preferred $37.17 for box of 5 =$7.43 each. So pay $148.68, get reimbursed $163.60.

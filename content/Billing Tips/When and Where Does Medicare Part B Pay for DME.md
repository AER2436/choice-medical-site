## 💡 Overview  

Medicare Part B covers **durable medical equipment (DME)** when:
1. The beneficiary meets coverage criteria per policy, **and**
2. The beneficiary resides in what Medicare defines as **home**.

Meeting medical necessity is often straightforward — either through prior authorization or documentation review — but identifying the **correct place of service (POS)** can be tricky. Knowing when a DME item is covered depends entirely on whether the POS qualifies as the patient’s home.

## 🏡 POS Codes Considered “Home” for DME Coverage  

If the beneficiary resides in any of the following locations, DME **is covered** under Medicare Part B when criteria are met:

| POS | Description |
|------|--------------|
| 04 | Homeless shelter |
| 13 | Assisted living facility |
| 14 | Group home |
| 33 | Custodial care facility |
| 54 | Intermediate care facility |

These are all considered the beneficiary’s **home** for DME purposes.

## 🏥 Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) & Nursing Facility (POS 31/32)

This is where things get complicated.  

**POS 31 (Skilled Nursing Facility)** and **POS 32 (Nursing Facility)** are **not** considered home — they are institutional settings. Therefore, **Medicare Part B cannot pay for DME** in these locations.  

### ⛔ When the Beneficiary Is Under a Part A Stay (First 100 Days)  
- The SNF is responsible for providing all medically necessary items.  
- Payment is included under **consolidated billing** for the Part A stay.  
- **Suppliers must bill the SNF directly**, not Medicare Part B.  
- Use **POS 31** → will result in a **CO (Contractual Obligation)** denial.  
  - Beneficiary **cannot** be billed.  
  - Secondary insurance **cannot** be billed.  

### 💵 When the Beneficiary Is Not Under Part A  
(After 100 days or private/self-pay)
- **Part B still cannot pay**, as POS 32 is not considered home.  
- The **beneficiary or secondary insurance may be billed.**  
- Use **POS 32** → results in **PR (Patient Responsibility)** denial.  
  - The beneficiary **can** be billed.

## ❓ Common Q&A  

**Q:** If the item is a custom or complex wheelchair, will Medicare B pay if the beneficiary is in POS 31/32?  
**A:** No. DME is only covered when the beneficiary resides in what Medicare considers home. POS 31/32 are institutional.  

---

**Q:** If the beneficiary is self-paying for the SNF stay, will Medicare B pay for a complex manual wheelchair (E1161)?  
**A:** No. Who pays for the room and board doesn’t matter — DME isn’t covered in POS 31/32.  

---

**Q:** What about long-term care (LTC)? Will Medicare B pay for a complex power wheelchair (K0861)?  
**A:** *Maybe.* There’s no specific POS for LTC — it depends on how the facility is licensed.  
- If the resident is in an **assisted living section (POS 14)** → DME *is* covered.  
- If in a **SNF section (POS 31/32)** → DME *is not* covered.  

---

**Q:** Another supplier says they’re getting paid for E1161s in SNFs during private-pay stays — how?  
**A:** Likely by using an incorrect POS (e.g., 12, 14, 33) that’s considered “home.”  
- Medicare’s system won’t catch this since there’s no active Part A stay in the file.  
- If done knowingly, this may constitute **fraud** (false claim).  
- Medicare can **recoup** payment and **refer to OIG** for investigation.  
➡️ **Suppliers must verify POS** before billing.  

---

**Q:** If a prior authorization or ADMC affirmation is obtained, can I go ahead and deliver the DME in a SNF?  
**A:** No. Prior authorization only verifies **medical necessity**, not **POS** eligibility.  

---

**Q:** Can I deliver a wheelchair to a SNF before discharge to train the beneficiary?  
**A:** Yes — Medicare allows a **48-hour training grace period.**  
- Deliver up to **48 hours prior** to discharge.  
- Beneficiary signs on delivery date, but **date of service = discharge date.**  
- Document in the file why it was delivered early (training prior to discharge).  

---

**Q:** Will Medicare B pay for DME if the beneficiary is on hospice?  
**A:** Yes, *only* if the DME is **unrelated** to the hospice diagnosis.  
- Use **GW modifier** on the claim.  
- Apply the **correct POS**.  
- If the POS isn’t considered home, coverage rules above still apply.

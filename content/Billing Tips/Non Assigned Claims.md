*Reference: [[Non Assigned Claims are NOT so Scary.pdf|Full PDF - Non assigned claims are not that scary]]


---

## 🩺 Overview
“Non-assigned” claims simply mean the DME supplier chooses **not to accept Medicare assignment** for that claim.  
The supplier is **not paid directly by Medicare** and may collect payment directly from the beneficiary.  
Despite the scary name, these claims are legitimate, regulated, and sometimes strategically beneficial.

## 🏛️ Participating vs. Non-Participating Suppliers
### Participating Supplier
- Must **always accept assignment** on all Medicare claims.  
- Paid directly by Medicare.  
- Bound by Medicare’s **fee schedule** as full payment.  
- Patient only owes **20% coinsurance** and unmet deductible.

### Non-Participating Supplier
- Can choose **per-claim** whether to accept assignment.  
- If **non-assigned**, supplier collects payment directly from the patient and Medicare reimburses the **beneficiary**.  
- Supplier can charge **more than Medicare’s allowed amount**, but must inform the patient first.  
- Payment goes to the patient, not the supplier.

---

## 💵 What “Non-Assigned” Really Means
- You file the claim to Medicare **for the patient’s reimbursement**, not your own.  
- The patient pays you **up front**.  
- Medicare sends the allowable payment (usually 80%) **directly to the patient**.  
- Suppliers must still use valid **HCPCS codes**, **modifiers**, and **documentation** as usual.

---

## ⚖️ Supplier Requirements
- Suppliers must be **enrolled and approved** with Medicare to submit non-assigned claims.  
- You **cannot** submit a claim “non-assigned” to avoid compliance requirements — all rules still apply.  
- You **must still issue an ABN** (Advance Beneficiary Notice) when required.  
- Always submit the claim electronically (or on a CMS‑1500 form) with the **“non-assigned” indicator.**

---

## 👩‍⚕️ Beneficiary Rights
- The beneficiary may **submit the claim themselves** if the supplier doesn’t.  
- They’ll receive payment directly from Medicare.  
- The patient can use this payment to reimburse the supplier or keep it if they already paid.  
- Medicare’s payment is still based on the **Medicare fee schedule**, regardless of what the supplier charged.

---

## 📜 Anti‑Discrimination and Fair Billing
- Suppliers **cannot discriminate** or refuse service solely because a patient uses Medicare.  
- Prices must be consistent and **reasonable**, even for non‑assigned claims.  
- Suppliers may charge higher than Medicare’s allowed rate, but must communicate **up front** what the patient will owe.  

---

## ⚙️ Upgrades and Patient Choice
- For upgrades (e.g., deluxe wheelchairs, advanced CPAP models):  
  - Supplier can offer the patient a **non‑assigned option** for upgraded features.  
  - The patient pays the difference out of pocket.  
  - Medicare reimburses the basic allowable amount to the patient.  
- Always document clearly that the patient **requested** and **agreed** to pay the difference.

---

## 💡 Why Suppliers Use Non‑Assigned Claims
- Avoids lengthy Medicare payment delays.  
- Allows flexible pricing for non‑covered or upgraded items.  
- Encourages patient choice for higher-end equipment.  
- Keeps suppliers compliant while maintaining revenue control.

---

## 🚫 Risks and Cautions
- You must still **submit the claim** to Medicare (even non‑assigned).  
- You cannot **balance bill** beyond what was agreed with the patient.  
- Always ensure **ABN forms** are issued properly when items are likely non‑covered.  
- Avoid misuse — non‑assignment is a privilege, not a loophole.

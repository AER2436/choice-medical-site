# 🏥 SNF and Nursing Facility Coverage Summary

## Medicare vs. Medicaid: Different Purposes
- **Medicare Part A (SNF)** pays for **short-term skilled nursing or rehab** after a qualifying **3-day hospital stay**.
- **Medicaid (NF/LTC)** pays for **long-term custodial care** once the patient no longer needs daily skilled therapy and meets income/resource limits.
- The same facility can operate under both programs; what changes is **who’s paying** and **what type of care** is being covered.

---

## Medicare Part A Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)
- Covers **up to 100 days** per benefit period if medical and hospital-stay criteria are met.
- Pays the facility a **bundled per-diem rate** that includes room, board, nursing, and most supplies/equipment.
- While Part A is active, **Part B DME can’t be billed separately** — all services and equipment are part of the SNF bundle.
- After day 100 (or when skilled need ends), Medicare Part A coverage stops; Part B can resume for eligible outpatient or home-based services.

---

## Medicaid Nursing Facility (NF/LTC)
- Covers **long-term custodial care** (help with ADLs, maintenance therapy, routine nursing).
- Pays the facility a **vendor per-diem rate** plus collects the resident’s **applied income** (their share of cost).
- That daily rate already includes **routine medical equipment and supplies**, so **DME can’t be billed to TMHP separately**.
- **Custom or personal-use items** not included in the vendor rate can sometimes be funded through an **Incurred Medical Expense (IME)** deduction.

---

## Private-Pay or Non-Covered SNF Stays
- When neither Medicare A nor Medicaid is paying, the stay is **private pay**.
- The patient is treated as being “at home” for Medicare B/DME purposes.
- DME suppliers may bill **Medicare B normally (POS 12 = home)** and Medicaid secondarily, since no per-diem is in effect.

---

## Applied Income & IME Basics
- **Applied Income** = the portion of a Medicaid resident’s monthly income paid to the facility toward their care.
- **IME (Incurred Medical Expense)** = Medicaid’s mechanism for allowing part of that applied income to be used for medical costs **not covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the facility’s per-diem** (e.g., custom equipment, dentures, hearing aids).
- HHSC approves IMEs so residents can pay suppliers directly without violating Medicaid cost-sharing rules.

## Quick Reference Table

| Stay Type | Primary Payer | DME Billing Allowed? | Notes |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Medicare A SNF | Medicare A (per-diem) | ❌ No | DME included in SNF bundle |
| Medicaid NF (applied income) | Medicaid vendor rate | ❌ No (except via IME) | Routine DME bundled |
| Private Pay | Resident/family | ✅ Yes | Bill Medicare B as “home” |
| Medicare A exhausted / no skilled need | None or Medicaid | ✅ Yes (if not per-diem) | Bill Part B if patient “home” |

---

## Bottom Line
- **Medicare A = short-term rehab**, everything bundled.  
- **Medicaid NF = long-term care**, routine items bundled.  
- **Private pay = bill normally**.  
- When in doubt, **check who’s paying the room & board** — that tells you whether your DME can be billed.

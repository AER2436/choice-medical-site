**DME Rental or Purchase**
The rental versus purchase decision is between the patient and
supplier. However, the rental of any equipment should not extend
more than 10 months duration. *If the prescription indicates*
*“lifetime” need, the supplier should attempt to sell the equipment*
*as opposed to renting.*

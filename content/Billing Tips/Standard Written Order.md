## ✅ Key Differences Between DWO and SWO

| Element | DWO (Before 2020) | SWO (2020 and After) |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Beneficiary | Name | Name or MBI |
| Description | General/HCPCS/Brand | Same, but allows combined list for equipment and supplies |
| Quantity | Frequency & quantity | Quantity if applicable |
| Physician/Practitioner | Signature + Signature date | Name or NPI + Signature |
| Structure | Multiple order types (DWO, 5EO, etc.) | Single standardized SWO format |

---

**Bottom Line:**  
The **SWO** streamlines documentation by combining prior order types into one standardized format. It must clearly identify the beneficiary, describe the item(s), include quantity if applicable, and be signed and dated by the treating practitioner.

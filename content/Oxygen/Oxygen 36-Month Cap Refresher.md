# Oxygen 36-Month Cap Refresher

## What this page is for
Use this when handling Medicare oxygen rentals approaching the cap, switching providers, determining billing responsibility, or resolving questions on the 36-month and 60-month cycles.

---

# 1. What the 36-Month Cap Means
Medicare pays **36 monthly rental payments** for oxygen equipment.

After month 36:
- The supplier is responsible for furnishing and maintaining the oxygen equipment at **no cost to the beneficiary**.
- Monthly rental billing **stops**.
- Medicare continues to pay for **oxygen contents** (E0443, E0441, E0442) if medically necessary.
- The beneficiary remains in a **60-month capped rental cycle**.

---

# 2. Supplier Responsibilities After Month 36
After the cap is reached, the supplier must:
- Maintain and service the concentrator
- Replace broken equipment (unless misuse)
- Provide backup tanks if medically needed
- Respond to service calls
- **Not** bill Medicare for rental or maintenance unless in a rare M&S case

In short: Medicare stops paying, but you don’t stop working.

---

# 3. What You *Can* Still Bill After Month 36
✔ **Portable oxygen contents**  
✔ **Liquid contents**  
✔ **Backup tanks** (if justified)  
✔ **Accessories** only in limited cases where not included in the original rental

---

# 4. What You Cannot Bill
❌ Rental items (E1390, E0431, E0434, etc.)  
❌ Concentrator replacements (unless 60+ month cycle reset)  
❌ Routine maintenance  
❌ Patient pickup / delivery fees  
❌ Restarts of capped rental

---

# 5. When the 60-Month Cycle Resets
A new 60-month cycle begins only when:
1. The full 60 months have passed, **and**
2. The patient still qualifies medically, **and**
3. A new initial claim is submitted

This is the only time rental billing may start over.

---

# 6. Patient Transfers

## A. Transfer BEFORE Month 36
- The new supplier takes over remaining rental months.
- Rental continues from whatever month the previous supplier left off.
- Requires:
  - SWO
  - Qualifying documentation
  - Proof of continued need

## B. Transfer AFTER Month 36
- The original supplier remains responsible for furnishing equipment through month 60.
- A new supplier **cannot bill rental**.
- A new supplier can accept the patient, but must do so **without rental payment**.
- Documentation proving release from responsibility is extremely rare.

Bottom line:  
**If the patient is capped, the responsibility follows the equipment, not the supplier.**

---

# 7. Maintenance & Servicing (M&S)
M&S billing is rare. It applies only when:
- The equipment is beyond useful life **after** the 5-year cycle, and  
- A home visit is medically required

In almost all other situations, M&S billing is not allowed.

---

# 8. Documentation Needed
- SWO  
- Medical necessity confirming ongoing need  
- Proof of patient use  
- Prior rental history (HETS lookup or internal records)  
- Contents necessity (if billing contents)

Lack of ongoing need documentation can cause contents denial.

---

# 9. Quick Reference Table

| Scenario | Billable? | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Months 1–36 | ✔ Rental | Standard rental cycle |
| Month 36+ | ❌ Rental | Supplier responsibility starts |
| Portable contents | ✔ | If medically necessary |
| Transfer <36 months | ✔ | Continue remaining rental months |
| Transfer >36 months | ❌ Rental | New supplier inherits responsibility |
| Replacement <60 months | ❌ | No reset |
| Replacement 60+ months | ✔ | New cycle begins |

---

# 10. Staff TL;DR
- 36 months = **no more rental billing**.  
- Supplier must still service equipment until month 60.  
- Contents may still be billable.  
- Transfers after month 36 = **you take responsibility, not rental revenue**.  
- New rental only after the full 60-month cycle ends.

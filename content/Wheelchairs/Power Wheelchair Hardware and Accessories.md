# Billing Power Wheelchair Electronics: Quick Guide

Confused about when to bill E2310, E2311, E2313, E2376, or E2377? Here's what you need to know.

## Key Terms

**Actuator** – The motor that moves a specific power seating function (tilt, recline, seat elevation, leg rests, etc.). Each function = one actuator.

**Expandable Controller** – Can accommodate alternative drive controls (head array, sip-and-puff) AND/OR operate 3+ actuators. Always bill with harness code.

**Harness** – All wiring, switches, and circuits needed for the expandable controller to work.

**Power Options** – Power tilt, recline, seat elevation, leg rests, or standing systems added to a power wheelchair.

## When to Bill E2377 + E2313 (Expandable Controller + Harness)

Bill these codes together when:

- **3 or more actuators** are present on the chair (e.g., power tilt + recline + seat elevation)
- **Alternative drive controls** are used (head array, sip-and-puff, etc.)

> [!tip] Always Together
> E2377 (initial) or E2376 (replacement) must always be billed with E2313 (harness). They're a package deal.

## When to Bill E2310 vs E2311

**E2310** – Use when the beneficiary operates **one power seating system** through the drive control.

**E2311** – Use when the beneficiary operates **two or more power seating systems** through the drive control.

## Common Scenarios

### Multiple Power Option Base with 3+ Actuators

**Example**: MPO base with power tilt + recline + seat elevation

**Bill**: E2377 + E2313 (because there are 3+ actuators)

Plus E2311 if they control 2+ functions through the drive control, or E2310 if they only control 1 function.

### Single Power Option Base with 2 Actuators

**Example**: SPO base with power tilt + seat elevation

**Do NOT bill**: E2377 or E2313 (only 2 actuators)

**Bill**: E2310 or E2311 depending on how many functions they control through the drive control.

### Alternative Drive Controls

**Example**: Any base using head array or sip-and-puff

**Bill**: E2377 + E2313 (alternative controls require expandable electronics)

## Important Reminder

> [!warning] Code Descriptions Include Components
> Many wheelchair accessory codes already include switches, mounting hardware, and electronics in their descriptions. Don't bill these components separately—they're not separately payable.

## Quick Reference Table

| Scenario | Actuators | E2377 + E2313? | E2310 or E2311? |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| MPO base (tilt + recline + seat elevation) | 3+ | ✅ Yes | Based on # of functions controlled |
| SPO base (tilt + seat elevation) | 2 | ❌ No | Based on # of functions controlled |
| Any base with head array/sip-puff | Any | ✅ Yes | Based on # of functions controlled |
| Base with single power tilt only | 1 | ❌ No | E2310 only |

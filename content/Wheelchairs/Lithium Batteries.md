# ⚡ Lithium Batteries for Power Wheelchairs — Correct Coding

**Purpose:** Clarify correct HCPCS coding for **lithium-based batteries** used with **power wheelchairs (PMDs)** and related accessories.  
*(Based on DME MAC Joint Publication — Revised Guidance)*  

---

## 🔋 Overview  

Medicare distinguishes between **lithium** and **lithium-ion** batteries:  

| Battery Type | Description | Rechargeable? | Typical for Powerchairs |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Lithium-ion** | Rechargeable, high capacity, long life | ✅ Yes | ✅ Power wheelchairs (K0800–K0898) and power assist systems (E0986) |
| **Lithium (standard)** | Disposable, single-use | ❌ No | ❌ Not used in powerchairs |

> [!warning]
> Only **lithium-ion batteries** (rechargeable) are used in **power mobility devices.**  
> Do **not** code PMD batteries as “lithium” (A4235, A4602, K0604, K0605) — those are for other device types.

## 🧾 Correct HCPCS Code for PMDs  

| HCPCS Code | Description | Use |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| **E2397** | *Power wheelchair accessory, lithium-based battery, each* | For all **lithium-ion** powerchair batteries or **power assist systems (E0986)** |

> [!tip]
> **E2397** covers both **replacement** and **original** lithium-ion batteries for power mobility devices.  
> If two batteries are supplied, bill **E2397 x 2**.  

---

## ⚙️ Documentation Requirements  

> [!check]
> - The **powerchair base** (K0800–K0898) or **power assist system (E0986)** must be listed on the claim or referenced in the **Claim Note**.  
> - Documentation must confirm the **battery is lithium-ion (rechargeable)** and **used with a covered PMD.**  
> - Keep manufacturer specifications showing it’s lithium-ion in your records.  
> - If replacing a battery, note the **original purchase date** and confirm **beneficiary-owned** equipment.  
> - Include PDAC-approved make/model if available.  

**Claim Narrative Example:**  
> “Replacement lithium-ion battery for K0861 power wheelchair.”

## 💡 Common Billing Scenarios  

| Situation | Correct Code | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| New powerchair delivered with lithium-ion batteries | **E2397 x 2** | Batteries billed as accessories at initial setup |
| Replacement lithium-ion battery | **E2397** | Document that beneficiary owns the powerchair |
| Power assist system (E0986) lithium-ion pack | **E2397** | Applies to manual chairs with assist motors |
| Lead-acid or sealed gel batteries | **E2365 / E2366** | Use only if NOT lithium-ion |

---

## ⚠️ Denial Prevention Tips  

> [!warning]
> - Never use **A-codes or K-codes** (A4601, K0604, etc.) for powerchair batteries — those apply only to infusion pumps or SGDs.  
> - Don’t omit the **base HCPCS reference** in your claim or documentation — E2397 alone without a PMD context can trigger development requests.  
> - Check your **PDAC file** or manufacturer data sheet if the battery chemistry is unclear.  
> - Verify replacement frequency — multiple replacements within 12 months can raise red flags.

## 🧾 Modifier Guidance  

| Modifier | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| **NU** | New battery |
| **RB** | Replacement (used if replacing within useful life) |
| **KX** | Coverage criteria met |
| **LT / RT** | Use only if base documentation requires it (rare) |

> [!tip]
> Most replacement battery claims = **E2397 NU KX RB** (when replacing one lithium-ion battery on a patient-owned PMD).

---

## ✅ Summary  

- ✅ Code **E2397** for all lithium-ion batteries used with power mobility devices (K0800–K0898) or power assist systems (E0986).  
- ✅ Bill **per battery**, not per set.  
- ✅ Include base HCPCS (wheelchair code) in your narrative or Claim Note.  
- ✅ Use proper modifiers (NU, RB, KX).  
- ✅ Keep PDAC or manufacturer documentation verifying lithium-ion chemistry.

> [!info]
> 💬 **Pro tip:** Some PMD manufacturers include both battery types in literature — always verify it’s “lithium-ion (rechargeable)” before coding **E2397**.  
> Document it once, and future replacement claims will sail through review.

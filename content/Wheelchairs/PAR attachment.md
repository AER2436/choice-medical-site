# Prior Authorization: Which Codes Attach to Base Only vs. All Accessories

When you're preparing a PA request for power wheelchairs, here's how it breaks down:

## PA Attaches to Base AND *All* Accessories

These codes mean the prior authorization, once affirmed, applies to the base and **all accessories** submitted—no matter if they're on the voluntary list or not:

- **K0005** – Ultralightweight wheelchair
- **E1161** – Manual wheelchair with one-arm drive mechanism (base rental)
- **K0823** – Power wheelchair, Group 2 very heavy duty (base rental)

## PA Attaches to Base + Voluntary Accessories Only

For these codes, the PA only covers the base **and** accessories submitted that are on the voluntary prior authorization list. Accessories not on the voluntary list go through standard claims review, even if you submit them on your PAR:

- **K0861** – Group 3 standard, multiple power options
- **K0841** – Group 3 heavy duty, multiple power options
- **K0843** – Group 3 very heavy duty, multiple power options

## PA Attaches to Base ONLY

For these codes, PA is strictly for the base—no accessories are included, so submit accessories through normal claims:

- **K0821** – Group 2 standard
- **K0825** – Group 2 heavy duty

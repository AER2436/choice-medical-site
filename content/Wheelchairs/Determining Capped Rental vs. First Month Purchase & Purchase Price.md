# Determining Capped Rental vs. First Month Purchase & Purchase Price

Let’s clear up one of the most confusing parts of DME billing: figuring out **when a power wheelchair or accessory is a capped rental only** and **when it qualifies for first-month purchase.**  
We’ll also look at how to **calculate the purchase price** from the rental fee schedule amount.

## 🦼 Power Wheelchairs and Capped Rental Rules

All **Power Wheelchairs** fall under the **Capped Rental** fee schedule category.  
However, not all are treated the same way — some have a **First Month Purchase Option**, while others **must** be rented for the full 13-month period.

### ⚙️ Complex Rehab Power Wheelchairs  
**HCPCS codes K0835–K0843 and K0848–K0864**

These are considered **Complex Rehabilitative Power Wheelchairs (CRPWCs)**.  
Suppliers **must give beneficiaries the choice** to either rent or purchase **at the time of initial setup**.

- If the beneficiary **chooses to purchase**, payment is made in a **lump sum**.  
- If they **choose to rent**, standard monthly payments apply (15% for months 1–3, then 6% for months 4–13).  
- **All capped rental accessories** used with these CRPWCs **also qualify for the first-month purchase option.**

> **Remember:**  
> - Use the **BP modifier** on capped rental items selected for purchase.  
> - **Do not use KH** on purchased capped rental items (KH is only for the first rental month).  
> - As of **Oct 1, 2018**, KH is **no longer required** on purchased (NU or UE) wheelchairs and accessories.

### 🪑 Standard Power Wheelchairs  
**HCPCS codes K0813–K0931 and K0898**

These **must be rented** following standard capped rental rules — **no first-month purchase option.**

Rental payments are calculated as:
- **Months 1–3:** 15% of the purchase price  
- **Months 4–13:** 6% of the purchase price  

Once 13 payments are made, ownership transfers to the beneficiary.

### 🔋 Inexpensive or Routinely Purchased Accessories  
Items like batteries, seat cushions, backs, and detachable/adjustable arms are always **Inexpensive/Routinely Purchased** — meaning they **can always be purchased outright.**

## 💰 Calculating the Purchase Price  

When you’re checking the **DMEPOS Fee Schedule**, the listed **rental (RR) amount** helps you calculate the total purchase price.

### 🧮 Power Base Calculations
| Type | Calculation | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Complex Rehab Power Base (with purchase option)** | Purchase Allowable = Rental (RR) ÷ 0.15 | 15% is the first-month rental rate |
| **Capped Rental Only Power Base** | Total Rental Allowable = (Rental ÷ 0.15) × 1.05 | 5% add-on for capped rental total |

---

### ⚙️ Accessory Calculations
| Type | Calculation | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Complex Rehab Accessory (with purchase option)** | Purchase Allowable = Rental (RR) × 10 | 10 months of payment total |
| **Capped Rental Only Accessory** | Total Rental Allowable = Rental (RR) × 10.5 | 10.5 months of total allowed rental value |

---

### 🏷️ Modifiers to Remember
| Modifier | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| **BP** | Required when a capped rental item is purchased |
| **KH** | Do **not** use for purchased items |
| **KY** | Required on accessories used with **Group 2 Complex Bases** when the patient lives in a **CB (Competitive Bidding) area** |

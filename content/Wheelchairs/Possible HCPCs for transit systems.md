3/28/25 `Looks like they are coming up with new codes for wheelchair transportation securement system and transit securement system. I think one would be for the chairs to be attached to the back of a vehicle and other might be to secure the wheelchair inside the vehicle. I am not entirely sure, but these codes are coming. I don't know that they will be covered by Medicare, as previously Medicare was requiring the transit systems to be billed as A9270 - Non-covered service.`

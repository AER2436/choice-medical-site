**Effective for dates of service on or after April 1, 2025**, CMS is revising HCPCS code E1028 and creating three (3) new HCPCS codes for wheelchair accessories:

1. Revise existing HCPCS Level II code **E1028**, "Wheelchair accessory, manual swingaway, retractable or removable mounting hardware for joystick, other control interface or positioning accessory" to instead read "Wheelchair accessory, manual swingaway, retractable or removable mounting hardware, ==other=="
2. Establish a new HCPCS Level II code **E1032**, "Wheelchair accessory, manual swingaway, retractable or removable mounting hardware used with j==oystick or other drive control interface.=="
3. Establish a new HCPCS Level II code **E1033**, "Wheelchair accessory, manual swingaway, retractable or removable mounting hardware for ==headrest, cushioned, any type=="
4. Establish a new HCPCS Level II code **E1034**, "Wheelchair accessory, manual swingaway, retractable or removable mounting hardware for ==lateral trunk or hip support, any type=="

Codes E1032, E1033 and E1034 are in the capped rental payment category. To avoid potential overpayments, items previously coded and billed under E1028 that are still in the capped rental period should continue to be billed under code E1028 rather than switching mid-capped rental to the new HCPCS code. Codes E1032, E1033 and E1034 must only be billed for new items dispensed with dates of service on or after April 1, 2025.

If the treating practitioner chooses to refer the beneficiary to an LCMP for a mobility evaluation, the treating physician's co-signature, dating and indicating agreement or disagreement with the LCMP evaluation must occur within this six (6) month timeframe.

**ATTENTION!**

Many suppliers have created forms which have not been approved by CMS which they send to practitioners and ask them to complete. Even if the practitioner completes this type of form and puts it in his/her chart, this supplier-generated form is not a substitute for the comprehensive medical record. Suppliers are encouraged to help educate practitioner on the type of information that is needed to document a beneficiary's mobility needs. The information that the supplier must obtain before submitting a claim to the DME contractor is described in detail in the Power Mobility Devices LCD and Policy Article. However, if the DME MAC or other Medicare Contractor asks for documentation on individual claims, additional documents (e.g., notes from prior visits, test reports, etc.) shall also be obtained from the treating practitioner to provide a historical perspective that reflects the beneficiary's condition in the continuum of care, corroborating the information in the face-to-face examination, painting a picture of the beneficiary's condition and progression of disease over time.

- ☐ **Specialty Evaluation**
    - ☐ Performed by licensed/certified medical professional such as PT or OT or practitioner who has specific training and experience in rehabilitation wheelchair evaluations.
    - ☐ Documents the medical necessity for the wheelchair and it's special features
    - ☐ Documents the beneficiary's seating and positioning needs
    - ☐ Provides detailed information explaining why each specific option or accessory is needed to address the beneficiary's mobility limitation
    - ☐ Person performing the evaluation has no financial relationship with the supplier
    - ☐ Author's signature meets CMS Signature Requirements ([https://www.crms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM6698.pdf](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.crms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM6698.pdf)) for a legible identifier
- ☐ **Supplier ATP Appraisal**
    - ☐ Copy of RESNA certificate or screen-print/printout of credential verification from RESNA website ([https://www.resna.org](https://www.resna.org)) verifying that the supplier employs a RESNA-certified Assistive Technology Professional (ATP) who specializes in wheelchairs
    - ☐ Evidence of "direct, in-person involvement" by the supplier's ATP in the selection of the wheelchair and accessories (e.g. evaluation conducted by the supplier's ATP clearly documented inclusion of the supplier's ATP name as an active participant in the specialty evaluation conducted by the treating practitioner or other LCMP)

**REMINDERS**

All new rental series claims for HCPCS Codes K0813-K0829, K0835-K0843, and K0848-K0864 with a date of delivery on or after July 22, 2019 must be associated with a prior authorization request as a condition of payment. If the requirements related to a face-to-face examination have not been met, the GY modifier must be added to the codes for the wheelchair and all accessories. If the wheelchair that is provided is only needed for mobility outside the home, the GY modifier must be added to the codes for the item and all accessories. A KX modifier may be added to the code for a wheelchair and all accessories only if all of the coverage criteria have been met for the product that is provided. If the requirements for use of the KX modifier or GY modifier are not met, the GA or GZ modifier must be added to the code. When there is an expectation of a medical necessity denial, suppliers must enter GA on the claim line if they have obtained a properly executed Advance Beneficiary Notice (ABN) or GZ if they have not obtained a valid ABN. Claim lines billed without a KX, GA, GY, or GZ modifier will be rejected as missing information. Items with no physician or other licensed health care provider order must be submitted with an "EY" modifier added to each affected HCPCS code.
